# Particle Fitlter

[Particle filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_filter) consists of estimating the internal states in dynamical systems when partial observations are made, and random perturbations are present in the sensors as well as in the dynamical system.

## Prerequisites

* numpy
* math
* opencv(cv2) - need to install with ``` pip install opencv-python-headless ```


## Use

Run the program and there will be another window pop up. Choose that window and start to use up arrow, down arrow, left arrow, right arrow to control the green circle in the map(you cannot move out of the map). The red points(actaully small circles) are the particles.

## Have fun!
